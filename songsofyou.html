                <br>"Sometimes all I think about is you." Whenever this song plays, I think about you without fail. Specifically, I think about that time 
                when we had first started going on dates. Even though that was only like 2 years ago, it still kind of makes me feel nostalgic. The 
                first semester after I had graduated, I had a really hard time focusing in class because you were on mind all the time.

                <br>"She looks just like a dream, the prettiest girl I've ever seen." I remember posting this song in the background to 
                some pictures of us on Prom night. You really did look like you belonged on the cover of a magazine. It really couldn't \
                have been more fitting. The song isn't anything crazy, and that's how I feel when I'm around you, comfortable and relaxed.

                <a href="https://genius.com/Ksi-and-lil-wayne-lose-lyrics" target="_blank"><b>"Lose" - KSI</b></a>
                <br>"She loves me, she loves me not, patience, I'm runnin' out. Walkin' all over me, made me her stompin' grounds." I listened 
                to this song all the time around the time that we had barely started talking. I couldn't really tell if you also liked me or if 
                you were just being friendly. Not gonna lie, this drove me crazy, I had no idea what to think. KSI is a youtuber so he isn't a 
                very talented musician, but this song that he did with Lil Wayne is spot on, it perfectly captures how I felt at this time.

                <a href="https://genius.com/Ed-maverick-del-rio-lyrics" target="_blank"><b>"Del Rio" - La Fe Norteña</b></a>
                <br>"Yo sé que te tengo pero no te tengo cerca de mí. Siento que algo falta y eso que me falta eres tú." So technically the song 
                was originally made by a guy named Ed Maverick, but I prefer this version because the original sounds too depressing. This song 
                reminds me of how you are going to leave soon for school. I always get a little sad when I really listen to this song. I felt it 
                was important to mention this song.

                <br>"I don't care how long it takes, as long as I'm with you, I've got a smile on my face." This is a really relaxing song too, 
                it makes me think about our future together. If I'm being honest, I feel like I've been getting really old, and it's kind of scary, 
                like damn, I'm already in my 20's? It still feels like I was in high school just a few months ago. Despite all this, the thought of 
                growing old together makes me feel better about getting older.

            <li>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4yte2kuno8" target="_blank">"Try Again" - D.ear</a>
                <p>I can't remember where I first heard this song, but the second half of this song feels so euphoric. Honestly, any korean song 
                    reminds me of you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1dvrcqlQgI" target="_blank">"Those Eyes" - New West</a>
                <p>I remember you posted a video of us just messing around with this song in the background. I teared up when I saw your story, I really 
                    appreciate the little moments we have together.
                </p>

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmO5aM8H_lA" target="_blank">"Out of my League" - Fitz and the Tantrums</a>
                <p>It really feels like you're out of my league sometimes. You deserve the absolute best, you shouldn't have to settle. That is why I try 
                    my best to make sure you get what you deserve.
                </p>

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSkWH8nBWeI" target="_blank">"Acurrucar" - Los Pescadores Del Río Conchos</a>
                <p>Honestly, I think of you with like 90% of Ed Maverick or Kevin Kaarl's songs. This one also reminds me of how you are going to leave 
                    for school soon. One day I'm going to wake up and wish it was just a dream.

                <p>This was my Spotify playlist that I made when we had started talking. I added songs the more we talked. I stopped listening to it around a month after we started dating, mainly because I just stopped using Spotify. 
                    Anyways, some of the songs make sense, most don't. Anyways, if you ever saw me in the halls with my earphones, chances are I was listening to this playlist.</p>
